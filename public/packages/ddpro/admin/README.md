## bower_components

This contains the bower installed components for AdminLTE and its dependencies.  The necessary assets from
here are included in the main template in [resources](/resources/README.md).

There are some additional packages installed here using bower.  See the bower.json file in the root directory
for the things that we have brought in.

Eventually all of the plugins in css/js should be bowerized and brought in via this directory (e.g. jquery, jquery plugins...).
